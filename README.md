# ML Engineering Journey

This repository documents my journey into ML Engineering, Cloud-Based Deployment, and Model Lifecycle Management. Each month, I tackle a new project that builds skills in various aspects of ML engineering.

## ðŸ“… Project Roadmap

1. **Month 1: ML Engineering Fundamentals**
   - Week 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
   - Week 2: Model Building and Evaluation
   - Week 3: ML Pipeline Creation
   - Week 4: Finalizing and Documenting the Project
   - **Goal**: Develop an end-to-end ML pipeline for a classification problem.

2. **Month 2: Cloud-Based Deployment**
   - Details will be added here as I progress.

3. **Month 3: Model Lifecycle Management**
   - Details will be added here as I progress.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **/data**: Contains datasets for each project.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with code and documentation for each month/week.
- **/src**: Custom modules (e.g., data preprocessing, model training).
- **README.md**: Overview of the repository and roadmap.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required libraries for easy setup.
- **.gitignore**: To keep unnecessary files out of your repository.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
